Version control systems are a category of software tools that helps record changes to files by keeping a track of modifications done to the code.

Use of Version Control System:

A repository: It can be thought as a database of changes. It contains all the edits and historical versions (snapshots) of the project.
Copy of Work (sometimes called as checkout): It is the personal copy of all the files in a project. You can edit to this copy, without affecting the work of others and you can finally commit your changes to a repository when you are done making your changes.
Types of Version Control Systems:

Local Version Control Systems
Centralized Version Control Systems
Distributed Version Control Systems
